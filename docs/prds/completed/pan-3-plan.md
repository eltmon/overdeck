# PAN-3: Comprehensive Agent Skills Suite - STATE

## Issue Summary
Create a full suite of `pan-*` skills that guide AI assistants through Panopticon operations. Skills should enable conversational guidance so users never need to learn CLI commands directly.

## Key Decisions

### 1. Skill Purpose
**Decision:** Skills are guidance wrappers + documentation.

Skills help AI assistants:
- Understand when to invoke which `pan` CLI commands
- Guide users through configuration decisions
- Provide context about how Panopticon components work together
- Offer troubleshooting guidance

### 2. Naming Convention
**Decision:** Use `pan-*` (dashes) for directory names.

- Directory: `~/.panopticon/skills/pan-help/`
- Skill name in SKILL.md: Can use `pan:help` or `pan-help` (both work for invocation)
- Matches existing skills: `bug-fix`, `feature-work`, `code-review-*`

### 3. Skill Location & Distribution
**Decision:** Repo is source of truth, runtime is a copy.

**Distribution flow:**
```
repo/skills/pan-*/           ← SOURCE OF TRUTH (version controlled)
       ↓ pan init / npm postinstall
~/.panopticon/skills/pan-*/  ← Runtime copy (user's machine)
       ↓ pan sync
~/.claude/skills/pan-*/      ← Symlinked for AI tools
```

**Workflow for creating/updating skills (for agents working on PAN-3):**
1. Create/edit skill in feature branch: `skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
2. Commit to feature branch (`feature/pan-3`)
3. Test locally by copying to `~/.panopticon/skills/` and running `pan sync`
4. When done with phase, PR/review
5. Merge to main
6. On release: `npm publish` includes skills in package
7. Users run `pan init` or update → skills copied to `~/.panopticon/skills/`

**Current workspace path:** `/home/eltmon/projects/panopticon/workspaces/feature-pan-3/`
**Skills directory:** `./skills/` (relative to workspace root)

**Note:** Phase 1 skills already exist in both:
- `~/.panopticon/skills/pan-*/` (working now via `pan sync`)
- `./skills/pan-*/` (committed to repo)

**Project-specific skills** (not Panopticon generic):
- Live in `{project}/.claude/skills/` (git-tracked in the project)
- These are NOT managed by Panopticon
- `pan sync` adds Panopticon skills alongside, never replaces project skills
- "Git-tracked always wins" - project skills take precedence

### 4. Docker Templates
**Decision:** Create app-type templates in `templates/docker/`

Templates needed:
- `spring-boot/` - Java/Spring with Maven, Postgres, Redis
- `react-vite/` - React with Vite hot-reload
- `nextjs/` - Next.js with app router
- `dotnet/` - .NET Core with SQL Server
- `python-fastapi/` - FastAPI with uvicorn
- `monorepo/` - Frontend + backend combo

Each template includes:
- `Dockerfile.dev` - Development Dockerfile
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service orchestration
- `README.md` - Usage instructions

### 5. Traefik/Networking
**Decision:** Traefik infrastructure already exists (PAN-4).

Skills (`pan-network`, `pan-docker`) will guide users through:
- Using existing Traefik setup
- Configuring workspace routing
- Platform-specific DNS setup (Linux, macOS, WSL2)

No new infrastructure needed - just guidance skills.

## Scope

### In Scope

**Skills to create (organized by priority):**

| Priority | Skill | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| P0 | `pan-help` | Entry point - overview of all commands and skills |
| P0 | `pan-install` | Guide through npm install, dependencies, env setup |
| P0 | `pan-setup` | First-time configuration wizard |
| P0 | `pan-quickstart` | Combined: install → setup → first workspace |
| P0 | `pan-up` | Start dashboard, API, Traefik |
| P0 | `pan-down` | Graceful shutdown of all services |
| P0 | `pan-status` | Check running agents, workspaces, health |
| P0 | `pan-plan` | Planning workflow with AI discovery |
| P0 | `pan-issue` | Create workspace + spawn agent |
| P1 | `pan-config` | View/edit Panopticon configuration |
| P1 | `pan-tracker` | Configure issue tracker (Linear/GitHub/GitLab) |
| P1 | `pan-projects` | Add/remove managed projects |
| P1 | `pan-docker` | Docker template selection and configuration |
| P1 | `pan-network` | Traefik, local domains, platform-specific setup |
| P1 | `pan-sync` | Sync skills to Claude Code |
| P1 | `pan-approve` | Review + approve agent work, merge MR |
| P1 | `pan-tell` | Send message to running agent |
| P1 | `pan-kill` | Stop a running agent |
| P1 | `pan-health` | System health check |
| P1 | `pan-diagnose` | Interactive troubleshooting |
| P2 | `pan-logs` | View logs from agents, dashboard, API |
| P2 | `pan-rescue` | Recover stuck agents, clean orphaned workspaces |

**Docker templates to create:**
- `templates/docker/spring-boot/`
- `templates/docker/react-vite/`
- `templates/docker/nextjs/`
- `templates/docker/dotnet/`
- `templates/docker/python-fastapi/`
- `templates/docker/monorepo/`

### Out of Scope

- New CLI commands (existing commands are sufficient)
- New infrastructure (Traefik already set up)
- State mapping configuration (`pan-states` deferred - complex topic)
- Skill creation guidance (`skill-creator` already exists)

## Architecture

### Skill Structure

Each skill follows this structure:
```
pan-{name}/
├── SKILL.md          # Main guidance content with YAML frontmatter
├── templates/        # (optional) Config templates, checklists
└── resources/        # (optional) Reference docs, examples
```

### Skill YAML Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: pan-help
description: Overview of all Panopticon commands and capabilities
triggers:
  - pan help
  - panopticon help
  - what can panopticon do
allowed-tools:
  - Bash
  - Read
---
```

### Skill Content Pattern

Skills should include:
1. **Overview** - What this skill helps with
2. **When to use** - Trigger conditions
3. **Workflow** - Step-by-step guidance
4. **CLI commands** - Which `pan` commands to run
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and fixes
