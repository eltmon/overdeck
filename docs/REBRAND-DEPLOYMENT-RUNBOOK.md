# Rebrand Deployment Runbook — External Ops

> The in-repo rebrand is **done** (PAN-1938/1960/1964/1952 all closed; cutover `cfcd3fca64`
> landed on `main` 2026-06-19). What remains is **external infrastructure** — DNS, hosting,
> and npm — that requires operator access to the Cloudflare, Vercel, Mintlify, and npm
> consoles. This runbook is the source of truth for those ops.
>
> **Target architecture:**
> - `overdeck.ai` → marketing landing site (static `site/`, served by Vercel)
> - `docs.overdeck.ai` → Mintlify docs (moved from `panopticon-cli.com`)
> - `panopticon-cli.com` → 301 redirect to `overdeck.ai`
> - npm: both `overdeck` (unscoped) and `@overdeck/core` resolve to the real release

## Prerequisites / current state (verified 2026-06-26)

| Resource | State |
|---|---|
| GitHub repo | Renamed → `eltmon/overdeck` (301 redirects old URLs) ✅ |
| `overdeck.ai` DNS | **Parked on Cloudflare, not resolving** ❌ |
| `docs.overdeck.ai` DNS | **Not configured** ❌ |
| `panopticon-cli.com` | **Live** — Mintlify docs on Vercel |
| `site/index.html` | Overdeck-branded, ready; `vercel.json` deploys `site/` ✅ |
| `@overdeck/core` on npm | v0.41.1 (the real package) ✅ |
| `overdeck` (unscoped) on npm | v0.0.1 — **deprecated placeholder** ❌ |
| `@panctl/cli` on npm | v0.21.0 — deprecated legacy |

## Phase 2a — Landing site: stand up `overdeck.ai` on Vercel

The [`vercel.json`](../vercel.json) at the repo root already configures everything:
`framework: null`, `outputDirectory: "site"`, build copies the `curl | sh` installer to
`site/install`, and serves `/docs` → `docs.overdeck.ai` as a permanent redirect.

1. **Create the Vercel project.** Import `eltmon/overdeck` into Vercel. Vercel reads
   `vercel.json` automatically — no build settings to configure. Output is the static
   `site/` directory.

2. **Add the custom domain.** In the Vercel project → Settings → Domains → add `overdeck.ai`
   (and `www.overdeck.ai` if desired). Vercel provides an A record / CNAME.

3. **Configure DNS in Cloudflare.** Add the records Vercel specifies for `overdeck.ai`:
   - Typically `A overdeck.ai → 76.76.21.21` (Vercel's anycast) and
     `CNAME www.overdeck.ai → cname.vercel-dns.com`.
   - **Cloudflare proxy (orange cloud):** leave DNS-only (grey cloud) for the initial
     verification, then enable proxying once Vercel confirms the domain is active. If the
     proxy is on during verification, Cloudflare may intercept Vercel's validation.

4. **Verify.** `curl -sI https://overdeck.ai` should return 200 and serve the landing page.

---

## Phase 2b — Docs: move Mintlify to `docs.overdeck.ai`

The Mintlify docs are currently published at `panopticon-cli.com` (Mintlify-hosted on
Vercel). Move them to `docs.overdeck.ai`.

1. **Add the custom domain in Mintlify.** In the Mintlify dashboard (dashboard.mintlify.com)
   → your project → Settings → Domains → add `docs.overdeck.ai`. Mintlify provides a
   CNAME target (e.g. `host.mintlify.com` or a Vercel-managed endpoint).

2. **Configure DNS in Cloudflare.** Add the CNAME Mintlify specifies:
   - `CNAME docs.overdeck.ai → <mintlify-provided-target>`.
   - Cloudflare proxy: Mintlify generally requires DNS-only (grey cloud) so their edge
     serves the SSL cert; enable proxying only if Mintlify documents it's supported.

3. **Verify.** `curl -sI https://docs.overdeck.ai` should return 308 → `/introduction`
   (Mintlify's entry redirect), matching the current `panopticon-cli.com` behavior.

4. **Update the docs homepage CTA** (already done in `docs.json`): the "Install" button
   points to `npmjs.com/package/overdeck`, GitHub links to `eltmon/overdeck`. No further
   `docs.json` changes needed.

---

## Phase 2c — Redirect `panopticon-cli.com` (DEFERRED — operator handles last)

> **Status: deferred.** The operator will handle `panopticon-cli.com` last, after
> `overdeck.ai` and `docs.overdeck.ai` are both live and stable. Do not touch this domain
> until then — it keeps serving the Mintlify docs as the active fallback.

When the time comes, external/cached links to `panopticon-cli.com/<doc-path>` must not
404. Since the old domain served **docs**, redirect doc paths to `docs.overdeck.ai`:

1. **Remove `panopticon-cli.com` from the Mintlify project** (after `docs.overdeck.ai` is
   verified and serving). This frees the domain.

2. **Set up a Cloudflare redirect rule.** Cloudflare → Rules → Redirect Rules on the
   `panopticon-cli.com` zone:
   - `*` → `https://docs.overdeck.ai${http.request.uri.path}` with a 301.
   - This preserves the path: `panopticon-cli.com/quickstart` →
     `docs.overdeck.ai/quickstart`.
   - The bare domain (`panopticon-cli.com`) → `https://docs.overdeck.ai`.

   > Alternative: redirect to `overdeck.ai` (marketing site) instead — it has prominent
   > "Docs" links so users reach docs in one click. Path-preserving → `docs.overdeck.ai`
   > is friendlier for deep-linked doc URLs.

---

## Phase 5 — npm: publish the unscoped `overdeck` package

The goal: `npx overdeck` works, in addition to `npx @overdeck/core`. The `overdeck`
(unscoped) package currently sits at v0.0.1 and is deprecated. It must resolve to the
same release as `@overdeck/core`.

**Two viable mechanisms** (pick one):

### Option A — dual-publish in the release workflow (recommended)

Add a publish step to [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml)
that swaps the package name and republishes the same tarball under `overdeck`:

```yaml
- name: Publish unscoped `overdeck` alias
  env:
    PKG_VERSION: ${{ needs.<version-source>.outputs.version }}
  run: |
    # The trusted-publisher config on npmjs.com for `overdeck` must pin this
    # repo + workflow (same as @overdeck/core) for OIDC to authorize the publish.
    if npm view "overdeck@${PKG_VERSION}" version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      echo "overdeck@${PKG_VERSION} already published — skipping"
      exit 0
    fi
    # Temporarily publish the built dist under the unscoped name
    npm version "${PKG_VERSION}" --no-git-tag-version --allow-same-version
    node -e "const p=require('./package.json'); p.name='overdeck'; require('fs').writeFileSync('./package.json', JSON.stringify(p,null,2)+'\n')"
    npm publish --provenance --access public --tag latest
```

> ⚠️ The **Trusted Publisher** config for the `overdeck` package on npmjs.com must be set
> to allow this repo + workflow file, exactly like `@overdeck/core`. Without it, OIDC
> publish is rejected. Configure this once in the npm web UI.

### Option B — thin wrapper package

Publish a tiny `overdeck` package whose only job is `@overdeck/core`:

```json
{
  "name": "overdeck",
  "version": "<same-as-core>",
  "bin": { "overdeck": "./node_modules/@overdeck/core/dist/cli/index.js" },
  "dependencies": { "@overdeck/core": "<same-version>" }
}
```

This is simpler to reason about but adds an install hop. Option A produces a single
self-contained tarball under each name.

### After publish

- **Deprecate `@panctl/cli`** (idempotent metadata write; the release workflow already
  notes this is done for `overdeck` and `@eltmon/panctl`).
- Once `overdeck` is live at the real version, update the landing site (`site/index.html`)
  and README to lead with `npx overdeck` (currently `npx @overdeck/core`, which also works).

## Phase 6 — Legacy cleanup (DECISION: keep import functionality)

**Decision (operator, 2026-06-26):** We **keep** the `panopticon.db` import functionality
and the `~/.panopticon` legacy-home resolver in the codebase. We do **not** delete users'
old `panopticon.db`, and the `--seed-from-legacy` import path stays available.

This means the following carve-outs from PAN-1964 **remain indefinitely** (do not remove):

- [`src/lib/paths.ts`](../src/lib/paths.ts) `getLegacyHome()` → `~/.panopticon` (import-only).
- `src/lib/overdeck/legacy-import.ts` — the opt-in importer that reads the old DB.
- The `LegacyImportDialog` in the dashboard settings (the "Import conversations from old
  Panopticon" UI).
- `pan up --seed-from-legacy` CLI path.

The live primary DB is `~/.overdeck/panopticon.db` (filename retained during the in-flight
dual-DB migration to `overdeck.db`; PAN-1908/1938/1979/1983). That filename is a separate
concern from the import functionality and is tracked under the data-remodel epic.
