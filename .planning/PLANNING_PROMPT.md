# Planning Session: PAN-478

## CRITICAL: PLANNING ONLY - NO IMPLEMENTATION

**YOU ARE IN PLANNING MODE. DO NOT:**
- Write or modify any code files (except STATE.md)
- Run implementation commands (npm install, docker compose, make, etc.)
- Create actual features or functionality
- Start implementing the solution

**YOU SHOULD ONLY:**
- Ask clarifying questions (use AskUserQuestion tool)
- Explore the codebase to understand context (read files, grep)
- Generate planning artifacts:
  - STATE.md (decisions, approach, architecture)
  - Beads tasks (via `bd create`)
  - Implementation plan at `docs/prds/active/{issue-id}-plan.md` (copy of STATE.md, required for dashboard)
- Present options and tradeoffs for the user to decide

When planning is complete, STOP and tell the user: "Planning complete - click Done when ready to hand off to an agent for implementation."

## Issue Details
- **ID:** PAN-478
- **Title:** Complete httpHandler adoption for remaining 4 route files + ensureLabel fix
- **URL:** https://github.com/eltmon/panopticon-cli/issues/478

## Description
## Context

PAN-470 (PR #474) rewrote route handlers to idiomatic Effect with `httpHandler()` wrapper, but only covered 9 of 13 route files. The remaining 4 largest files still use raw `Effect.promise(async () => { try/catch })`.

Merged as-is to unblock other work — this issue tracks completing the migration.

## What's Missing

### 1. Routes not yet wrapped with `httpHandler` (4 files)
- `agents.ts` — 0 httpHandler calls, 57 try/catch blocks
- `issues.ts` — 0 httpHandler calls
- `specialists.ts` — 0 httpHandler calls
- `workspaces.ts` — 0 httpHandler calls

The following 9 files ARE done:
resources.ts (7), metrics.ts (8), misc.ts (1), mission-control.ts (7), remote.ts (9), costs.ts (11), settings.ts (6), conversations.ts (7), cloister.ts (9)

### 2. `github-client.ts` — `ensureLabel` still uses raw `fetch()`
`removeLabel` was fixed to use `ghFetch()` but `ensureLabel` was missed.

### 3. Remove redundant try/catch
Routes that are now wrapped with `httpHandler` should let typed errors flow through the error channel instead of catching them locally.

## Approach

Follow the same pattern established in PAN-470:
- Wrap each route in `httpHandler(...)` 
- Replace `Effect.promise(async () => { try { ... } catch { ... } })` with proper Effect generators
- Replace `Effect.runSync(service.method(...))` with `yield* service.method(...)`
- Map typed errors to HTTP status codes via the existing `httpHandler` wrapper

## Your Mission

You are a planning agent conducting a **discovery session** for this issue.

### Phase 1: Understand Context
1. **If a spec file was provided above**, read it thoroughly — it's your primary input
2. Read the codebase to understand relevant files and patterns
3. Identify what subsystems/files this issue affects
4. Note any existing patterns we should follow

### Phase 2: Discovery Conversation
Use AskUserQuestion tool to ask contextual questions:
- What's the scope? What's explicitly OUT of scope?
- Any technical constraints or preferences?
- What does "done" look like?
- Are there edge cases we need to handle?

### Difficulty Estimation

For each sub-task, estimate difficulty using this rubric:

| Level | When to Use | Model |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `trivial` | Typo, comment, formatting only | haiku |
| `simple` | Bug fix, single file, obvious change | haiku |
| `medium` | New feature, 3-5 files, standard patterns | sonnet |
| `complex` | Refactor, migration, 6+ files, some risk | sonnet |
| `expert` | Architecture, security, performance, high risk | opus |

### Phase 3: Generate Artifacts (NO CODE!)
When discovery is complete:
1. Create STATE.md with decisions made
2. Copy STATE.md to implementation plan at `docs/prds/active/{issue-id}-plan.md` (required for dashboard)
3. Create a vBRIEF plan file at `.planning/plan.vbrief.json` — **MUST follow the exact format below**
4. Summarize the plan and STOP

**DO NOT run `bd create` commands.** Beads tasks are created automatically from `plan.vbrief.json` by Cloister when planning completes.

### vBRIEF Plan Format (REQUIRED)

The plan file MUST conform to vBRIEF v0.5 spec (https://github.com/deftai/vBRIEF).
It MUST have exactly two top-level keys: `vBRIEFInfo` and `plan`.

```json
{
  "vBRIEFInfo": {
    "version": "0.5",
    "created": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",
    "author": "panopticon-cli/0.0.0",
    "description": "Plan for PAN-478: <issue title>"
  },
  "plan": {
    "id": "pan-478",
    "title": "<issue title>",
    "status": "approved",
    "uid": "<generate a UUID v4>",
    "author": "agent:claude-opus-4-6",
    "sequence": 1,
    "created": "<ISO 8601 timestamp — same as vBRIEFInfo.created>",
    "updated": "<ISO 8601 timestamp — same as created>",
    "references": [
      { "uri": "https://github.com/eltmon/panopticon-cli/issues/478", "label": "PAN-478", "type": "issue" }
    ],
    "tags": ["<relevant tags>"],
    "narratives": {
      "Problem": "<what problem this solves>",
      "Proposal": "<the approach chosen>"
    },
    "items": [
      {
        "id": "<short-kebab-id>",
        "title": "<task title>",
        "status": "pending",
        "priority": "medium",
        "created": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",
        "metadata": {
          "difficulty": "trivial|simple|medium|complex|expert",
          "issueLabel": "pan-478"
        },
        "narrative": { "Action": "<what needs to be done>" },
        "subItems": [
          {
            "id": "<parent-id>.ac1",
            "title": "<specific testable acceptance criterion>",
            "status": "pending",
            "metadata": { "kind": "acceptance_criterion" }
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      { "from": "<source-item-id>", "to": "<target-item-id>", "type": "blocks" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL vBRIEF rules:**
- The file MUST have `vBRIEFInfo` and `plan` as the ONLY top-level keys
- `plan.id` MUST be the issue ID in lowercase (e.g., "pan-478")
- `plan.uid` MUST be a freshly generated UUID v4
- Do NOT use `issue`, `issueId`, or `issue_id` — use `plan.id`
- `items[].status` MUST be one of: draft, proposed, approved, pending, running, completed, blocked, cancelled
- Acceptance criteria MUST be `subItems` with `metadata.kind: "acceptance_criterion"`
- `metadata.difficulty` and `metadata.issueLabel` are Panopticon extensions to the vBRIEF spec
- Edge types: `blocks` (hard dependency), `informs` (soft), `invalidates`, `suggests`

**IMPORTANT:** Create the plan file BEFORE creating beads tasks.
**NOTE:** `*-spec.md` files are human-written specs — do NOT overwrite them. Your output is `*-plan.md`.

**Remember:** Be a thinking partner, not an interviewer. Ask questions that help clarify.

Start by exploring the codebase to understand the context, then begin the discovery conversation.
